@article{Prekopa2003,
abstract = {Probabilistic programming means two strongly connected models as well as the study of their mathematical properties, solutions of the relevant optimization problems and their applications. The two models are: maximizing (or minimizing) a probability under constraints and programming under probabilistic constraints. There are a number of variants and special cases of these models and we present them in Section 1. In Section 2 we summarize those mathematical theories which can be used to prove the convexity of large classes of our problems and we also show how they can be applied in this context. In Section 3 we present solution algorithms of our stochastic programming problems. Since we are handling probabilities of sets in higher dimensional spaces, it is necessary to use bounding and other approximation algorithms to find these probabilities with satisfactory precision. This is the subject of Section 5. In Section 4 we present two-stage and multi-stage problems which are combined with probabilistic constraints. Some duality and stability theorems are presented in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we present applications of our model constructions. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wagstaff2012,
abstract = {Much of current machine learning (ML) research has lost its connection to problems of import to the larger world of science and society. From this perspective, there exist glaring limitations in the data sets we investigate, the metrics we employ for evaluation, and the degree to which results are communicated back to their originating domains. What changes are needed to how we conduct research to increase the impact that ML has? We present six Impact Challenges to explicitly focus the field’s energy and attention, and we discuss existing obstacles that must be addressed. We aim to inspire ongoing discussion and focus on ML that matters.},

@article{Winn2005,
abstract = {This paper presents Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to a Bayesian Network. Like belief propagation, Variational Message Passing proceeds by passing messages between nodes in the graph and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing ad- ditional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational Mes- sage Passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS’) which allows models to be specified graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.},
