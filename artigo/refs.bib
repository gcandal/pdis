abstract = {Probabilistic programming means two strongly connected models as well as the study of their mathematical properties, solutions of the relevant optimization problems and their applications. The two models are: maximizing (or minimizing) a probability under constraints and programming under probabilistic constraints. There are a number of variants and special cases of these models and we present them in Section 1. In Section 2 we summarize those mathematical theories which can be used to prove the convexity of large classes of our problems and we also show how they can be applied in this context. In Section 3 we present solution algorithms of our stochastic programming problems. Since we are handling probabilities of sets in higher dimensional spaces, it is necessary to use bounding and other approximation algorithms to find these probabilities with satisfactory precision. This is the subject of Section 5. In Section 4 we present two-stage and multi-stage problems which are combined with probabilistic constraints. Some duality and stability theorems are presented in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we present applications of our model constructions. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
